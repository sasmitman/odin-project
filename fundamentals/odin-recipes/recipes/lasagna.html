    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley,
            basil, 1
            teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring
            occasionally.
        </li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10
            minutes. Drain
            noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
        <li>
            In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
        </li>
        <li>
            To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles
            lengthwise over
            meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the
            mozzarella cheese
            slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
        </li>
        <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking,
            either spray
            foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.
        </li>
    </ol>
